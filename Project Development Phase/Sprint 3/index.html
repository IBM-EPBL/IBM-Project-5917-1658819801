<h1 style="color:black;">Crude oil price prediction</h1>
<p style="color:blue;"> Demand for oil is inelastic, therefore the rise in price is good news
    for producers because they will see an increase in their revenue.</p>
    <p style="color:blue;">Oil importers, however, will experience increased costs of purchasing oil,</p>
    <p style="color:blue;"> Because oil is the largest traded commodity, the effects are quite significant.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;"> A rising oil price can even shift ecomomic/political power from oil importers
            to oil exporters.</p>
            <p style="color: blue;">The crude oil price movements are subject to diverse 
                influencing factors</p>
